# Frontend web Developer

My web developer journey started in 2016 when I learned how to put web pages together with HTML and CSS. My interest in the field grew and I progressed to learning how to program with Javascript and get comfortable with the command line.

## Self Starter

I'm a 100% self-taught web developer. I enjoy learning new things and creating projects to realize what I learn.
